		 * execute the body and then you check the condition again or if the condition false
		 * you get out of the loop. so you could check the condition at the begining. 
		 * 
		 * do { body of the code } while ( conditions);
		 * flow of execution: run the body loop=> check the condition => go back to the body
		 * of the loop, the difference is first you run the body of the loop and then you 
		 * check the condition, it guarantees that you run the body at least once
